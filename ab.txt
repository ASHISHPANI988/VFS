With no sign of any wreckage from the Indian Air Force plane that disappeared on Friday with 29 people on board, the search area in the Bay of Bengal is being widened, said officials today.

With 17 ships, a submarine and 23 aircraft failing to detect debris on the surface of the sea, the entire operation now depends on picking up a signal from the elusive Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) fitted on to the AN-32 transport plane that was headed from Chennai to Port Blair when it disappeared without sending a distress signal.
